# Best Practices

Guidelines and recommendations for building robust RouteMQ applications.

## Project Organization

### Router Organization
- Group related routes in separate files (e.g., `devices.py`, `sensors.py`)
- Use descriptive names for router files
- Keep router files focused on a single domain

### Controller Organization
- One controller per domain or entity type
- Use static methods for stateless operations
- Keep controllers focused and single-purpose
- Use dependency injection for external services

### Middleware Organization
- Create reusable middleware components
- Keep middleware lightweight and focused
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, rate limiting)

## Performance Best Practices

### Redis Usage
- Use appropriate expiration times for cached data
- Prefer JSON operations for complex data structures
- Use Redis pipelines for bulk operations
- Monitor Redis memory usage and performance

### Database Operations
- Use connection pooling for database connections
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Use indexes for frequently queried fields
- Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

### MQTT Optimization
- Use appropriate QoS levels (0 for non-critical, 1 for important, 2 only when necessary)
- Enable shared subscriptions for high-throughput topics
- Configure worker counts based on processing requirements
- Use message persistence judiciously

## Security Best Practices

### Authentication and Authorization
- Always validate API keys and tokens
- Use middleware for authentication checks
- Implement role-based access control
- Cache authentication results with appropriate TTL

### Data Protection
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Log security events for monitoring

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation
- Implement fallbacks when external services are unavailable
- Use circuit breakers for unreliable dependencies
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Monitor application health and performance
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Track key business metrics
- Use structured logging for better analysis

## Testing Best Practices

### Unit Testing
- Test controllers, middleware, and models separately
- Mock external dependencies (Redis, database, MQTT)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios

### Integration Testing
- Test complete message flows
- Use test containers for external dependencies
- Test rate limiting and authentication
- Verify database operations

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Based Configuration
- Use different configurations for different environments
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variable validation
- Document all configuration options

### Feature Flags
- Use feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Store feature flags in Redis for runtime changes
- Implement A/B testing capabilities
- Monitor feature flag usage

## Deployment Best Practices

### Docker and Containers
- Use multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Don't run containers as root
- Use health checks in containers
- Set resource limits appropriately

### Production Deployment
- Use blue-green or rolling deployments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use load balancers for high availability
- Plan for disaster recovery
